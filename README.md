This is a mental calculation game running on python, a side project while I was starting to learn programming in 2020.

It has the user management feature to allow different user login with password, it also stores the best playing records for each user.

It's small, simple and fun.  

I beat 9 questions in Timd Mode and I love mental calculation.

## How To Use :
1. Download all the 5 py files in the same folder.
2. Run mental_calculation_game.py in python console.
3. Have fun.
